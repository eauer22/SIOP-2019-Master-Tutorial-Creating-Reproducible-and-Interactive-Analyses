# Installing JupyterLab
While there are multiple ways to download JupyterLab, it's recommended that you download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

* If you're not comfortable with command line, I would recommend installing the GUI version (select 64-Bit Graphical Installer). Python 3 is also recommended. Anaconda is availible for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

* For installation instructions, Anaconda has great documentation: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Once you have Anaconda downloaded, you should be able to open the Anaconda Navigator, which will look something like this:

You'll also be able to install and launch JupyterLab inside the navigator. 



If you want to use R, you'll need to create a new environment that includes R by going to the "Environments" tab on the left. You'll need to create a new environment and add an R Kernel. For more details see: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/create-r-environment/

Now all you need to do is launch JupyterLab!
