# SIOP-2019-Master-Tutorial-Creating-Reproducible-and-Interactive-Analyses-with-JupyterLab-and-Binder-
This tutorial demonstrates two data science tools that enable IO psychologists to create interactive, literate code documents, enabling others to replicate analyses with one click on the web. 

This is a repository of materials associated with the SIOP 2019 Master Tutorial Creating reproducible and interactive analyses with JupyterLab and Binder.
